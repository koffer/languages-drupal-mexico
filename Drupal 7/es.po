"\"CAPTCHA\" is an acronym for \"Completely Automated Public Turing "
"test to tell Computers and Humans Apart\". It is typically a "
"challenge-response test to determine whether the user is human. The "
"CAPTCHA module is a tool to fight automated submission by malicious "
"users (spamming) of for example comments forms, user registration "
"forms, guestbook forms, etc. You can extend the desired forms with an "
"additional challenge, which should be easy for a human to solve "
"correctly, but hard enough to keep automated scripts and spam bots "
"out."
msgstr ""
"\"CAPTCHA\" es un acrónimo para \"Prueba de Turing pública y "
"automática para diferenciar a máquinas y humanos\"(de \"Completely "
"Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart\"). Es "
"típicamente un test de desafío-respuesta para determinar si el "
"usuario es un humano. El módulo CAPTCHA es una herramienta contra los "
"envíos automáticos de usuarios maliciosos(spamming) de por ejemplo "
"formularios de comentarios de foros, formilarios de registro de "
"usuarios, formularios de libro de visitas, etc. Puede extender los "
"formularios deseados con un desafío adicional, el cual debe ser "
"fácil de resolver correctamente para los humanos, pero "
"suficientemente difícil para mantener a los scripts automáticos y "
"robots de spam fuera."

"Note that the CAPTCHA module interacts with page caching (see <a "
"href=\"!performancesettings\">performance settings</a>). Because the "
"challenge should be unique for each generated form, the caching of the "
"page it appears on is prevented. Make sure that these forms do not "
"appear on too many pages or you will lose much caching efficiency. For "
"example, if you put a CAPTCHA on the user login block, which typically "
"appears on each page for anonymous visitors, caching will practically "
"be disabled. The comment submission forms are another example. In this "
"case you should set the \"%commentlocation\" to \"%separatepage\" in "
"the comment settings of the relevant <a href=\"!contenttypes\">content "
"types</a> for better caching efficiency."
msgstr ""
"Tenga en cuenta que el módulo CAPTCHA interactua con la caché de "
"páginas (consulte <a href=\"!performancesettings\">opciones de "
"rendimiento</a>). Como la pregunta debe ser distinta para cada "
"formulario generado, la caché de la página en la que aparece queda "
"inutilizada. Asegúrese de que estos formularios no aparezcan en "
"demasiadas páginas o la caché perderá mucha eficiencia. Por "
"ejemplo, si pone una pregunta CAPTCHA en el bloque de comienzo de "
"sesión como usuario, que suele aparecer en cada página que ve un "
"usuario anónimo, la caché quedará virtualmente desactivada. En ese "
"caso, debería disponer el %commentlocation\" en\"%separatepage\" en "
"las opciones de comentarios de los <a href=\"!contenttypes\">tipos de "
"contenido</a> relevantes para ajustar la eficiencia de la caché."

"    You can create as many Feeds importer configurations as you would "
"like to. Each can have a distinct purpose like letting your users "
"aggregate RSS feeds or importing a CSV file for content migration. "
"Here are a couple of things that are important to understand in order "
"to get started with Feeds:\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <ul>\n"
"    <li>\n"
"    Every importer configuration consists of basic settings, a "
"fetcher, a parser and a processor and their settings.\n"
"    </li>\n"
"    <li>\n"
"    The <strong>basic settings</strong> define the general behavior of "
"the importer. <strong>Fetchers</strong> are responsible for loading "
"data, <strong>parsers</strong> for organizing it and "
"<strong>processors</strong> for \"doing stuff\" with it, usually "
"storing it.\n"
"    </li>\n"
"    <li>\n"
"    In Basic settings, you can <strong>attach an importer "
"configuration to a content type</strong>. This is useful when many "
"imports of a kind should be created, for example in an RSS aggregation "
"scenario. If you don't attach a configuration to a content type, you "
"can use it on the !import page.\n"
"    </li>\n"
"    <li>\n"
"    Imports can be <strong>scheduled periodically</strong> - see the "
"periodic import select box in the Basic settings.\n"
"    </li>\n"
"    <li>\n"
"    Processors can have <strong>mappings</strong> in addition to "
"settings. Mappings allow you to define what elements of a data feed "
"should be mapped to what content fields on a granular level. For "
"instance, you can specify that a feed item's author should be mapped "
"to a node's body.\n"
"    </li>\n"
"    </ul>\n"
"    "
msgstr ""
"\n"
"    <p>\r\n"
"    Puede crear la cantidad de configuraciones de importadores de "
"Feeds que quiera. Cada uno puede tener un propósito distinto, como "
"permitir que sus usuarios agreguen fuentes RSS o importar un archivo "
"CSV para migración de contenido. Aquí hay unas cuantas cosas que son "
"importante entender para poder empezar con Feeds:\r\n"
"    </p>\r\n"
"    <ul>\r\n"
"    <li>\r\n"
"\tCada configuración de importador consiste de opciones básicas de "
"configuración, un recuperador, un analizador y un procesador, y sus "
"opciones de configuración.\r\n"
"    </li>\r\n"
"    <li>\r\n"
"\tLas <strong>opciones básicas de configuración</strong> definen el "
"comportamiento general del importador. Los "
"<strong>recuperadores</strong> son los responsables de cargar los "
"datos, los <strong>analizadores</strong> de organizarlos, y los "
"<strong>procesadores</strong> de «hacer cosas» con ellos, usualmente "
"guardarlos.\r\n"
"    </li>\r\n"
"    <li>\r\n"
"\tEn las opciones básicas de configuración, usted puede "
"<strong>adjuntar una configuración de importador a un tipo de "
"contenido</strong>. Esto es útil cuando se deberían crear muchas "
"importaciones de un tipo, por ejemplo en un escenario de agregación "
"RSS. Si no adjunta una configuración a un tipo de contenido, puede "
"utilizarlo en la página !import.\r\n"
"    </li>\r\n"
"    <li>\r\n"
"\tLas importaciones pueden ser <strong>planificar "
"periódicamente</strong> - ver la caja de selección de importaciones "
"periódicas en las opciones básicas de configuración.\r\n"
"    </li>\r\n"
"    <li>\r\n"
"\tLos procesadores pueden tener <strong>mapeos</strong> además de "
"opciones de configuración. Los mapeos permiten definir cuáles "
"elementos de una fuente de datos deberían ser mapeados a cuáles "
"campos de contenido en un nivel granular. Por ejemplo, puede "
"especificar que el autor de un elemento de la fuente sea mapeado al "
"cuerpo de un nodo.\r\n"
